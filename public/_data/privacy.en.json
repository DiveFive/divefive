This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard information when you use our website, mobile applications, and related services (collectively, the “Services”).\n\nBy accessing or using the Services you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please discontinue use of the Services.\n\n## Information We Collect\n\n### Information you provide directly\n- **Account data.** When you create or manage a DiveFive account we collect your name, email address, preferred locale, and password. If you sign in with Apple we receive the email address and name you approve for sharing.\n- **Dive logs and notes.** You may enter information about your dives, locations, gear, photos, and personal notes. This content stays private to your account unless you explicitly choose to share it with a buddy.\n- **Support inquiries.** If you contact us for help we keep a record of your message and any files you attach.\n\n### Information collected automatically\n- **Usage data.** We collect limited diagnostic data such as the pages you visit, the buttons you tap, approximate session time, and device type to help us maintain performance. We do not track your precise location without permission.\n- **Device and network data.** The Services record IP address, operating system, browser version, language, and crash logs for security monitoring and troubleshooting.\n\n### Information from third parties\nIf you connect DiveFive with Apple Health or other platforms, we receive the data you authorize. You may revoke sharing at any time from the connected service’s settings.\n\n## How We Use Information\nWe use personal information to:\n1. Provide, personalize, and improve the Services.\n2. Sync your dives and preferences across devices.\n3. Send transactional messages such as security alerts or service updates.\n4. Respond to requests, provide customer support, and fix issues.\n5. Analyze trends to plan new features and ensure platform reliability.\n6. Protect the Services against fraud, abuse, and violations of our Terms.\n\nWe do not sell or rent personal information. We only use aggregated or de-identified statistics for marketing.\n\n## How We Share Information\nWe share personal information only with:\n- **Service providers** that process data on our behalf (hosting, analytics, customer support). They are bound by confidentiality obligations.\n- **Your approved collaborators** when you invite another diver to view shared logs or plans.\n- **Legal authorities** when required to comply with applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request.\n\nIf we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets we will notify you before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.\n\n## Data Retention\nWe retain personal information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the Services.

We may keep limited records required for legal, security, or backup purposes.\n\n## Your Choices\n- **Access and updates.** Update account details or download your data from the application preferences.\n- **Localization.** Choose your preferred language from the Settings menu or the website header.\n- **Communications.** You may opt out of promotional emails by following the unsubscribe link.

You may enable or disable these permissions at any time in the device settings.\n\n## International Transfers\nDiveFive is headquartered in the United States and stores data on servers located in the United States and the European Union. When we transfer personal information across borders we rely on approved transfer mechanisms and implement appropriate safeguards.\n\n## Security\nWe implement administrative, technical, and physical measures designed to protect personal information, including encryption in transit, secure key management, and access controls. No system is completely secure; if we detect a breach we will notify affected users and authorities as required by law.\n\n## Children’s Privacy\nThe Services are not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us data, contact us so we can delete it.\n\n## Changes to This Policy\nWe may update this Privacy Policy periodically. If changes are material we will notify you via email or in-app message before the new terms take effect. Continued use of the Services after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.\n\n## Contact Us\nIf you have questions or requests related to privacy, contact us at:\n\nDiveFive Privacy Team  \nprivacy@divefive.app  \n341 Seamount Avenue, Suite 5  \nPort Townsend, WA 98368, USA\n"
