# DiveFive Design Philosophy

DiveFive prioritises operational clarity for professional dive teams. Every surface aligns with three pillars:

1. **Utility-first** — Interface elements surface only the data required to plan, execute, and review dives.
2. **Security-forward** — Messaging emphasises data integrity, audit trails, and compliance readiness.
3. **Multilingual access** — Copy and content adapt instantly across English, Español (México), and Français to support international crews.

Layouts favour dense summaries, minimal ornamentation, and consistent semantic spacing. Gradients and accent hues highlight actions without overwhelming mission-critical information.
