You are responsible for ensuring your account credentials remain secure and for all activity that occurs within the app. DiveFive may suspend access if suspicious or abusive behavior is detected, or if payment obligations for premium features are not met.

DiveFive is provided “as is” without warranties. We are not responsible for injuries or losses that occur during diving activities. Always follow local regulations, training agency guidance, and your certified limits when planning dives.

These terms are governed by the laws of the United States. Disputes will be resolved through binding arbitration in California, unless a different jurisdiction is required by law. Updates to these terms will be posted on divefive.app.
